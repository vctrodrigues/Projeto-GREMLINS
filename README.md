# GREMLINS

## 1. Introduction

In this project, we developed a memory manager using singly linked list, called GREMLINS. A memory manager is important in situations in which it's necessary to have total control over the organization of memory and to improve the time performance associated to memory requests from the target application.

## 2. Compiling

This project may be compiled with [CMake](https://cmake.org).
CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
Basically, cmake reads a script (`CMakeLists.txt`) with meta-information on the project and **creates a Makefile automatically**, tailored to your system configuration.
After that, you may run the `make` command, as usual.

To compile the project you should follow these steps into the root folder:

1. `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..`: asks cmake to create the Makefile based on the script found in `CMakeLists.txt`.
2. `make`: compiles the codes and generate an executable into `./bin` folder.

## 3. Testing

To run the tests, you can choose between the executables generated by the compiler.

## 4. Authorship
